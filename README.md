 📊 Dash Dashboard
Using Dash we can create an interactive dashboard without any HTML and CSS files. All we need is to create Python file to process and visualize the data, as well as basic knowledge about HTML and styling. For me, using Dash helps me to make the interactive dashboard more easier.

 📌 Overview
This project is a **Dash-based interactive dashboard** that provides **filtering, data visualization, and CSV export functionality**. It allows users to apply multiple filters dynamically and view the filtered dataset in a table format.

 🚀 Features
- **Interactive Filters**: Select filters for Status, Client Name, Queues, Monthly Minimum, and Channel.
- **Scrollable Filter Section**: Keeps the layout clean by enabling vertical scrolling.
- **Dynamic Table Updates**: Displays filtered data in a table that updates based on user selections.
- **CSV Export**: Download the filtered dataset as a CSV file.

 📜 Usage
1. **Apply Filters**: Click on filter buttons to refine data.
2. **View Data**: The table updates dynamically based on selected filters.
3. **Download Data**: Click the "Download" button to export the filtered results as a CSV file.

 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Dash** (for the interactive web-based UI)
- **Plotly** (for data visualization)
- **Pandas** (for data processing)
- **HTML/CSS** (for layout and styling)
